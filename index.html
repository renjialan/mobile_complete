            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/Main.JPG"  class="main_img" width = "400" alt="light gray cat on blue blanket">

            <p>
                Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            </p> 
            <P>
                Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.  
            </P>

            <p>
                Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
            </p> 
            <P>
                Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged. 
            </P>

                Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for occasional swims.            </p> 
            <P>
                As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.

            <p>
                Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.            </p> 
            <P>
                Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

            <p>
                Happy is an old cat. He spends a lot of his day lounging around, in whatever spot he feels is most comfortable at the time. He’s an indoor cat, but whenever we open the door to let the dogs out, he always comes running out so he can eat grass.
            </p> 
            <P>
                Happy is pretty friendly with one of my dogs, Katie. They don’t interact much, but when they do, it’s usually just friendly sniffs. My other dog, Izzy, however, loves biting at Happy. Happy usually will just run away, but sometime’s he’ll retalliate by giving Izzy a smack! It’s all in good fun though.

            <p>
                Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.
            </p> 
            <P>
                Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.
            </P>
